## Overview
### Description
A social media app where users can post and share their favorite sites, restaurants, attractions, and places all around the world.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Social Media/Travel
- **Mobile:** Map, location, camera feature/pictures, push
- **Story:** A lot of times when travelling it is hard to figure out what to do, with this app you can see recommendations from other people (friends, celebrities, and randoms) without falling into tourist traps.
- **Market:** Anybody who travels and/or likes to document cool finds/places that they've been to.
- **Habit:** Scrolling through places where others have been is addicting. Any time somebody wants to find something new to do, they can log onto the app.
- **Scope:** The app works better when more people are on it. However, if I can get just 5 people to go on it from a certain area, then it would work nicely.
